Simple app showing the currently active offers of two German discount stores, namely EDEKA and REWE.
The app utilizes the APIs provided by the discounters themselfes.

## Usage
On the app start screen, the user can search for a postal code (REWE, EDEKA) or location and store name
(only REWE) and select one of the shop search results to display the offers. If supported by the shop's
API, the offers will be categorized.

## Screenshots
(soon)

## Outlook
This software was written as a small side project to try out Android application programming.
There may or may not be feature updates and/or additional supported stores.

## TODO
- Add screenshots
- Show licenses of used libraries in app
- Remove nested RecyclerView
